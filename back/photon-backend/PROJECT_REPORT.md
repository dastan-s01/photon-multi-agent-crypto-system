## Abstract

This report presents **Photon**, a multi-agent automated trading system that uses artificial intelligence to make trading decisions based on real-time market data. The system consists of three specialized agents: Market Monitoring Agent, Decision-Making Agent, and Execution Agent, which work together to monitor markets, analyze data, and execute trades.

The system successfully implements all required components: three working agents with clear communication, AI-powered decision making using machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting), integration with real market data sources (yfinance for stocks, Bybit API for cryptocurrencies), and a complete trading workflow from data collection to trade execution.

Key achievements include: (1) successful agent communication via message passing, (2) AI model achieving 65-80% test accuracy, (3) robust error handling with multiple data source fallbacks, (4) backtesting capabilities with historical data simulation, and (5) comprehensive REST API for system integration.

The system demonstrates a complete trading process: Market Monitor collects data, Decision Maker analyzes and decides, Execution Agent executes trades. All agents communicate through a centralized message system, and the entire workflow is logged and trackable through the API.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Automated trading systems have become increasingly important in modern financial markets. However, building a reliable system that can monitor markets, make intelligent decisions, and execute trades requires complex coordination between multiple components. Traditional monolithic systems lack flexibility and are difficult to maintain.

The challenge is to create a system that:
- Monitors real-time market data from multiple sources
- Makes intelligent trading decisions using AI
- Executes trades reliably
- Handles errors and missing data gracefully
- Provides clear communication between components

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a multi-agent trading system that:

1. **Implements 3 Working Agents**: Market Monitor, Decision Maker, and Execution Agent
2. **Enables Agent Communication**: Agents communicate via message passing
3. **Uses AI for Decisions**: Implements machine learning models for trading decisions
4. **Works with Real Data**: Integrates with real market data sources
5. **Demonstrates Complete Workflow**: Shows the full trading process from monitoring to execution
6. **Handles Errors**: Implements robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 1.3 Project Scope

This project focuses on:
- Multi-agent architecture design
- AI model implementation for trading decisions
- Real market data integration
- Agent communication mechanisms
- Trade execution (simulated mode)
- Backtesting capabilities

The system does not include:
- Real money trading (simulated execution only)
- Advanced order types (market orders only)
- Multiple exchange support (focused on yfinance and Bybit)

## 2. Background & Related Work

### 2.1 Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems (MAS) are computational systems composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact with each other to achieve common or individual goals. In trading systems, agents can represent different functions: data collection, analysis, decision making, and execution.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Agent Autonomy**: Each agent operates independently
- **Agent Communication**: Agents communicate via messages
- **Agent Coordination**: Agents coordinate to achieve system goals

### 2.2 Automated Trading Systems

Automated trading systems use algorithms to execute trades without human intervention. Key components include:
- **Market Data Collection**: Real-time price and volume data
- **Signal Generation**: Technical indicators and analysis
- **Decision Making**: Buy/sell/hold decisions
- **Order Execution**: Trade execution and confirmation

### 2.3 Machine Learning in Trading

Machine learning has been widely applied to trading:
- **Supervised Learning**: Classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for buy/sell/hold predictions
- **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD) as features
- **Continuous Learning**: Models retrain on new data

### 2.4 Related Work

Previous work in automated trading includes:
- **QuantConnect**: Cloud-based algorithmic trading platform
- **Zipline**: Python algorithmic trading library
- **Backtrader**: Python backtesting library

Our approach differs by:
- Focus on multi-agent architecture
- Clear agent separation and communication
- AI model integration with continuous learning
- Multiple data source support with fallbacks

### 3.2 Agent Design

#### 3.2.1 Market Monitoring Agent

**Responsibilities**:
- Fetch market data from external APIs
- Compute technical indicators
- Analyze market conditions
- Send data to Decision Maker

**Data Flow**:
```
External APIs (yfinance/Bybit) 
  → Market Monitoring Agent 
  → Technical Indicators 
  → Market Analysis 
  → Message to Decision Maker
```

**Key Components**:
- Data fetching (with retry logic)
- Indicator calculation (SMA, RSI, MACD)
- Trend analysis (bull/bear/sideways)
- Message creation

#### 3.2.2 Decision-Making Agent

**Responsibilities**:
- Receive market data from Market Monitor
- Extract features for AI model
- Use AI model to predict action
- Apply risk management
- Send decision to Execution Agent

**Data Flow**:
```
Market Data 
  → Feature Extraction (14 features) 
  → AI Model (Random Forest/Gradient Boosting) 
  → Risk Management 
  → Decision (BUY/SELL/HOLD) 
  → Message to Execution Agent
```

**AI Model**:
- **Type**: Supervised Learning (Classification)
- **Algorithms**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Features**: 14 features (price, volume, indicators, trend)
- **Classes**: SELL (0), HOLD (1), BUY (2)
- **Training**: Historical data + continuous learning

#### 3.2.3 Execution Agent

**Responsibilities**:
- Receive decisions from Decision Maker
- Validate decisions
- Execute trades (simulated/real)
- Update account balance
- Record trades

**Data Flow**:
```
Decision (BUY/SELL/HOLD) 
  → Validation 
  → Execution (with slippage/commission) 
  → Account Update 
  → Trade Record
```

### 3.3 Communication Design

Agents communicate through a **Message Model** in the database:

```python
class Message(models.Model):
    from_agent = CharField()  # MARKET_MONITOR, DECISION_MAKER, EXECUTION
    to_agent = CharField()
    message_type = CharField()  # MARKET_SNAPSHOT, TRADE_DECISION, EXECUTION_REPORT
    payload = JSONField()  # Message data
    timestamp = DateTimeField()
```

**Message Types**:
1. **MARKET_SNAPSHOT**: Market Monitor → Decision Maker
2. **TRADE_DECISION**: Decision Maker → Execution Agent
3. **EXECUTION_REPORT**: Execution Agent → (logs)

## 6. What Worked & What Didn't

### 6.1 What Worked Well

✅ **Multi-Agent Architecture**:
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easy to test and maintain
- Scalable design

✅ **AI Model Integration**:
- Automatic training on first use
- Continuous learning from real trades
- Good prediction accuracy (65-80%)

✅ **Data Source Flexibility**:
- Multiple fallback mechanisms
- CSV support for backtesting

- Easy integration

### 6.2 Challenges & Solutions

❌ **Challenge 1: yfinance Blocking**
- **Problem**: yfinance API sometimes blocks requests
- **Solution**: Implemented CSV file fallback, Bybit API for crypto
- **Result**: System works reliably with multiple data sources

❌ **Challenge 2: Bybit 200 Candle Limit**
- **Problem**: Bybit API returns only 200 candles
- **Solution**: Reduced minimum training samples to 30, adapted model parameters
- **Result**: Model trains effectively on smaller datasets

❌ **Challenge 3: Too Many HOLD Predictions**
- **Problem**: Model predicted HOLD 98.5% of the time
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced min_confidence threshold
  - Added class_weight='balanced' to model
  - Improved training data labeling
- **Result**: Reduced HOLD to 8.5%, increased BUY/SELL activity

❌ **Challenge 4: Negative Balance Calculation**
- **Problem**: Balance didn't account for open positions
- **Solution**: Changed balance formula to `balance = free_cash + used_margin`
- **Result**: Correct balance calculation

### 6.3 Limitations

⚠️ **Current Limitations**:
- Simulated execution only (no real trading)
- Limited to market orders (no limit/stop orders)
- Single exchange support (yfinance + Bybit)
- No real-time WebSocket updates
- Limited to single user per instance
